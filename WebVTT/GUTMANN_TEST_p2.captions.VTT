Q: Dr. Gutmann, I wanted to go back to something you said earlier about your interactions with Michele Cahill during the board meetings. You said that she knows you as someone who asks hard-hitting questions and I wondered if you can think of any of the particular programs that were presented and the ways that you interrogated those ideas.&amp;#13;
Gutmann: A few board meetings ago, we had a set of presentations by some software companies on what they could do to move K-12 education forward. And listening to those presentations, I felt that if you believed these PowerPoints, you would think that by adopting this set of technologies, K-12 education would just go to heaven. I mean, it was presented as the panacea. And I said that. I said, “As a listener, you’re giving us a sales pitch that if we believe, we shouldn’t be sitting on the board because it’s just hype, it’s a sales pitch. And that doesn’t help. I want to know what, realistically, this can do for K-12 education. If we’re going to support funding these technologies, let’s be realistic because K-12 education—the history is littered with claims of panaceas.” And Michele took that to heart. Fast-forward to our board meeting today and we had a much more realistic presentation of what the technology needs are, what it can do, what it can’t do, what we need from teachers far beyond technology. Just total change, and I credit Michele with that. She’s the one who leads this forward and she gets it. She really does get it.&amp;#13;
Q: But you asked the question.&amp;#13;
Gutmann: Yes. It’s just a question. Board members at their best are, I think, constructive provocateurs. And what we provoke is just better work from really, really talented staff people.&amp;#13;
Q: So it sounds like the board, the current board of the Carnegie Corporation that Vartan has put together is a collection of provocateurs.&amp;#13;
Gutmann: True.&amp;#13;
Q: Okay. I want to switch now to the relationship between Carnegie the corporation and Penn and, specifically, the 2009 [Academic] Leadership [Award] Grant that you won from the Corporation. Can you tell us a little bit about what that meant to you and how you used the funds?&amp;#13;
Gutmann: When I got a call from Vartan saying that Carnegie had voted for me and Penn to get the Leadership Award—because it really is an award for the institution and I’m privileged to be the president who gets the award—I was really bowled over because the award is recognizing universities that are making a difference in their community and that are integrating knowledge across boundaries and providing access to students who otherwise wouldn’t have the opportunity. And that’s just what the Penn Compact is about. And Vartan said, “This is in recognition of what the Penn Compact has done for the University of Pennsylvania and our community and society.” That was such an important endorsement of what I’ve been doing with a great team at Penn. And then, on top of that, it comes with a monetary award that the university can use to further what we’ve been doing. I immediately saw it as a challenge of putting those resources to the kind of use for which Carnegie Corporation could be proud and we’ve really been able to do that.&amp;#13;
Q: Tell us a little bit about how you’re using the money.&amp;#13;
Gutmann: The first thing I thought about was, how could we make the biggest difference moving forward? And the answer is, use these resources to enable students, undergraduate and graduate students, to put their knowledge to maximum use. So we set out on two programs for undergraduates and graduate students to do interdisciplinary, integrated knowledge research projects that would potentially show how you could improve society, and we’ve had a whole variety of those projects because of the Carnegie Corporation funding. For example, one student has a project doing robotic haptic technology, trying to figure out by using a variety of knowledge bases how you can get robots to be able to have a sense of touch, which is really important to be able to move certain medical technologies forward. And then we also had students who do great projects in the humanities that are connected to looking at the history of arts and culture in West Philadelphia, our local community. And then at the graduate level, we have seeded funding for graduate students who really have excellent interdisciplinary research projects to present those projects at conferences so they can launch themselves in their careers and we can fund the next generation of great integrated knowledge scholars and teachers.&amp;#13;
Q: Do you follow up with any of the students?&amp;#13;
Gutmann: Yes.&amp;#13;
Q: Do you follow their careers?&amp;#13;
Gutmann: Yes. It’s one of my great pleasures as president. And I always tell people if you’re at all depressed about the world, come to Penn and meet our students because it’s the best antidepressant you can have and you don’t need a doctor’s prescription for it. So I spend a lot of time every week meeting with students and finding out what they’re doing, and I write letters of recommendation for them and I take an interest in their work.&amp;#13;
Q: And I would imagine some of their work also connects them to the community in West Philadelphia?&amp;#13;
